# Portfolio - Tribute to Nise da Silveira

Each artwork is generated using:
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Trigonometric functions for circular patterns
- **Controlled Randomness**: Unique but aesthetically balanced compositions
- **Real-time Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas API for instant generation
- **Multiple Pattern Types**:
  - Sacred Mandalas (circular geometric patterns)
  - Fractal Trees (recursive branching structures)
  - Mathematical Spirals (logarithmic and Archimedean spirals)
  - More things
